 * A Project description

# Project-1---Beyonce-Jeopardy
This is my first full project for GA-WDI18 where I demonstrate skills learned in our Unit 1 section

- There will be two users that will select the "push" on each category question 
- Users will either select player 1 / player 2 upon the correct answer
- The points will go to player 1 or player 2 in the corners
